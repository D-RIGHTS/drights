                            The first question ever asked was, 'Who or what is D-RIGHTS'?

                        <p>
                            It is a name that <em>Dumisani Rodrick Ndhlovu</em> stumbled upon in his teen age while playing GT-3.
                            There was a car which always won and it was Labelled D-Rights and since his first name also started with D,
                            and the second name R, D-Rights has been his favored stage name.
